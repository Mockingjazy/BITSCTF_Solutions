Alice and Bob are on a mission which requires a dual-login inside 10 minutes, othwewise the system melts down and the administrators would be able to track them.
Eve got access the Alice-Bob channel which had a leak in it and retrieved some information.
She heard them and wrote some code to get the secret and log into the system before Bob can.
Both Bob and Eve have 57 seconds to log in to the system as everything would be reset the moment clock strikes 12.

Can you finish Eve's script to get the secret flag?
