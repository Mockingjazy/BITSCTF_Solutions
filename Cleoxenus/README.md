## Cleoxenus

- Something regarding Cleoxenus.
- If we search the word up on Google in context of cryptography, we realize that he was involved in Polybius Square.
- We see Polybius Square is a cipher with many variations. Maybe we need one of those here.
- Fritz? We look up Fritz. Fritz Cipher maybe?
- Googling Fritz Cipher gives us ADFGVX cipher.
- We see this cipher has a smaller ancestor version too, ADFGX cipher.
- Our current ciphertext looks encoded tho. Small research and we know it's base64.
- Decode this base64 and use the ADFGX cipher, as we have to use the **smaller one amongst the two**.
- But what key? Read the question again. Research :)
