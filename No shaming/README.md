## No Shaming

- Lots of stuff in this. We inspect the page. 
- Something about using KEY. Also we're asked to look through headers of the page.
- We visit the Network tab and check the headers.
- A header named hint says something about robots.
- Searching about robots on the server makes us go at /robots.txt
- We see ```coo-KEY``. Looks like a subtle **key** reference from the mainpage comments.
- Sounds liek cookie ngl.
- Cookiess, damn? We check cookies of this page again and see a cookie named KEY.
- We use this key to login but it asks us to inspect again.
- Oof, gotta use **I have the KEY** as my solution and replace the KEY with my cookie from /robots.txt
